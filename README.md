# EdgarRenderer
EDGAR Renderer enables investors to view the interactive data filings submitted under the US Security and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) rules that require the use of XBRL via the SEC website. 

EDGAR Renderer was created by staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Data and content created by government employees within the scope of their employment are not subject to 
domestic copyright protection. 17 U.S.C. 105.

End user support is by e-mail direct to SEC at: Ask-OID@sec.gov

Developer issue management is by the Jira Edgar Renderer project: https://arelle.atlassian.net/projects/ER

This is the master branch, as originally contributed by SEC.  (The 3.2.0.727 branch was in production use from 6/22/2015 to 9/27/2015.  The 3.3.0.814 branch has been in production use as validator from 9/14/2015 to 12/11/2015 and as renderer from 9/28/2015 to 12/8/2015.  The edgr154 branch has been in production use as renderer since 12/9/2015 and as validator since 12/14/2015.)
The plugin branches reconfigure SEC's EdgarRenderer as a dynamically installable Arelle plugin (correspondingly named plugin, plugin.3.2.0.727 and plugin.3.3.0.814).  The plugin provides EdgarRenderer features to existing integrated usage of Arelle by a command line interface, by java and c# interface and by RESTful server interface.
